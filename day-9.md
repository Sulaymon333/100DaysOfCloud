# Day 9 of #100daysofcloud

### I went deeper into different aspects of AWS compute using AWS doc and completed two mock tests on the same topic for my AWS SAA-C03 certification prep. More real-world resume projects on Terraform with AWS

- I dug further into the AWS doc on the instances buying option. I investigated the reserved instance discounted options. I learned about the savings billing discount, savings plans, and how reserved instance pricing works in general. See more details here https://lnkd.in/dWANfcq5
- I learned the 4 main determinants for reserved instance pricing. The four instant variables are instance type, the region where the reserved instance is purchased, platform - Windows, Linux/Unix, Tenancy - shared or dedicated (single-tenant) hardware
- I learned about the 3 payment options for reserved instances purchase - All upfront (highest discount, unlimited hours), Partial upfront (medium discounted hourly rate paid even when not in use), and No upfront (the lowest discounted hourly rate paid even when not in use)
- it is possible to modify, exchange or sell reserved instances that you no longer need via the Reserved Instance Marketplace or through AWS offering class.
- I took two mock exams on AWS compute and I had an opportunity to do a quick knowledge check with the mock exams on the Cloud Academy platform, I can review all the questions. Both the ones I got correct and the ones I missed with full explanations. This helps solidifies learning and understanding.

- I settled for 20 real-world resume projects on Terraform with AWS. This will be started in a few days :)
