Day 8 of #100daysofcloud

I revised more tricks with files/folders creation in Linux, investigated more terraform projects, and continued studying compute for my AWS SAA-C03 certification

- I played with touch, cat, echo, mkdir (using appropriate flags), and so on to create new files and folders

- I learned the bash script-like command FOR writing to a file using cat command

  ```bash
   cat << EOF > <filename>
   > some content
   > more content
   > EOF
  ```

- using -p flag with mkdir will create a new or nested parent folder even though it does exit earlier

- I played with mv, cp, rm commands to manage/delete files and folders

- I used the tree command to display current folder content in a tree-leaf structure

- I research new project-based terraform courses and prepare dev environments for new terraform projects

- I continued studying AWS compute resources on Cloud Academy

- I studied EC2, how to launch EC2 instance in AWS, user data, and buying options (on-demand, scheduled, reserved, on-demand capacity reservation, and spot options)
- I learned EC2 tenancy options (shared, dedicated instances, and dedicated hosts )
- I learnt about managed ECS service called Fargate
- I learned what ECS is all about and what problem it solves
- I understood the differnce between launch configuration and launch template (newer option) for EC2 Autoscaling group
