Day 6 of #100daysofcloud

I spin off a couple of web servers from the command line using python, php, node & apache, continued my Terraform with AWS project, and started studying for my AWS SAA-C03 certification

- I used one-liners in python, php, node, and apache to start web servers
- I used the curl command with different flags (-v, o, I), also the wget command to interact with webpage codes and analyse both request and response header data

- I ssh into the deployed EC2 instance from the terminal
- I set up a local VScode server for the deployed EC2 instance using Remote SSH extension, ssh-config file, and provisioners in terraform
- I learned that provisioners do not affect the terraform state.
- I learned that terraform -replace will trigger a rebuild of our state from scratch and it is useful when provisioners are used for example
- I started studying for my AWS SAA-C03 certification path on Cloud Academy.
