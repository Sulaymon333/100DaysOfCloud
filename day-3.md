# Day 3 of #100daysofcloud

### I experimented with package management in Linux and I created AWS resources using Terraform

- I played with the important package managers on Debian-based Linux - dpkg, apt, aptitude, and snap store

- I learned that apt is more powerful and intuitive than dpkg. apt can help take care of package dependencies. Snap store is another quick and snappy way to install packages from different repositories

- I played with different apt/dpkg commands (install, remove, update, upgrade, full-upgrade, list, show, purge, etc)

- I learnt yum and dnf (newer) are used for managing packages on red-hat-based Linux distros for example CentOS/Red Hat Enterprise Linux

- I completed my AWS profile setup in VSCode for my IAM entity that programmatically interacts with AWS via CLI/SDK

- I created and manage aws resources using terraform commands from the CLI

- I investigated the two static analysis tools VSCode extensions suggested in my last post (Checkov and tfsec) for secure terraform codes

- I equally researched the best platform to use for a structure study path for my cloud journey and cloud certifications. My research boils down to only two options - (A Cloud Guru and Cloud Academy). I am considering cloud acadmey since they seems to have richer content. All suggestions and recommendations are welcomed in the comment section below.
